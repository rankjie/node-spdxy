node-spdy-proxy
===============

spdy/https proxy server based on node-spdy

It can be used as a standalone proxy server
or being embedded and/or extended in another
node.js application.

###Why SPDY?

SPDY improves connection latency and throughput by
compacting multiple streams in one tls connection and
enabling gzip compression by default. According to Google,
SPDY promises 27% to 60% speedup over HTTP and 39 - 55%
over HTTPS [1].

###What is the Purpose of node-spdy-proxy?

By deploying a SPDY proxy between the client and the 
non-SPDY-enabled Internet, it can potentially improve the
Internet latency from the client's perspective. Especially
when the connection between the browser and the actual
website is slow, the full TCP roundtrips saved by SPDY
can dramatically reduce the site loading times, the rationale
behind Amazon Silk [2].

A lightweight SPDY proxy written in Node.js offers the benefit
of SPDY without the hassle of setting up a full-blown proxy
server, and thus comes node-spdy-proxy.
